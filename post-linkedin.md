# LinkedIn Post: RAG Chatbot Learning Project

ðŸ¤– Just completed an intensive hands-on project building a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot** as part of Anthropic's Claude Code course!

**What I built:**
âœ… Full-stack RAG system with FastAPI backend and vanilla JS frontend  
âœ… Document processing pipeline that structures course materials into searchable chunks  
âœ… ChromaDB vector store with semantic search capabilities  
âœ… Claude AI integration with tool calling for intelligent query routing  
âœ… Session management for context-aware conversations  

**Key technical highlights:**
ðŸ”§ **Backend**: FastAPI with Pydantic models, uvicorn server, CORS middleware  
ðŸ”§ **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude with custom educational prompts and search tools  
ðŸ”§ **Vector Search**: ChromaDB + sentence-transformers for semantic similarity  
ðŸ”§ **Architecture**: Clean separation between document processing, vector storage, AI generation, and session management  

**What I learned:**
ðŸ“š How to design and implement production-ready RAG systems  
ðŸ“š Vector embeddings and semantic search optimization  
ðŸ“š AI tool calling patterns and conversation context management  
ðŸ“š Full-stack integration between AI backends and user interfaces  

The system automatically processes course documents, creates searchable knowledge bases, and provides intelligent responses with source citations. Perfect for educational content Q&A!

Ready to apply these RAG techniques to real-world applications. The future of AI-powered knowledge systems is here! ðŸš€
