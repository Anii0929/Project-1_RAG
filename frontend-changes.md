# Frontend Changes - API Testing Infrastructure Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the existing testing framework for the RAG system with comprehensive API endpoint testing infrastructure. This implementation focuses on testing the backend API endpoints that serve the frontend application.

## Changes Made

### 1. pytest Configuration (pyproject.toml:25-36)
- Added `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section with test discovery settings
- Configured `asyncio_mode = "auto"` for async test support  
- Added test markers: `unit`, `integration`, `api`
- Set cleaner output options with `-v --tb=short --strict-markers`
- Added new test dependencies: `httpx>=0.25.0`, `pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0`

### 2. Enhanced Test Fixtures (backend/tests/conftest.py:161-304)
- **mock_rag_system**: Mock RAG system for API testing with predefined responses
- **test_app**: Complete FastAPI test application without static file mounting issues
- **client**: TestClient fixture for making HTTP requests to API endpoints
- **temp_docs_dir**: Temporary directory with test documents for integration testing

### 3. Comprehensive API Endpoint Tests (backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py)
New test file with 67 total tests covering:

#### Basic Endpoint Functionality
- **Root endpoint** (`/`): Tests welcome message response
- **Query endpoint** (`/api/query`): Tests query processing with/without session
- **Courses endpoint** (`/api/courses`): Tests course statistics retrieval
- **Session management** (`/api/sessions/clear`): Tests session clearing functionality

#### Error Handling
- Exception handling in all endpoints with proper 500 status codes
- Invalid JSON and missing parameter validation (422 status codes)
- Non-existent endpoint handling (404 status codes)

#### Data Validation
- Empty query strings and very long queries
- Unicode character support in queries
- Mixed source format handling (dict vs string sources)

#### Response Format Consistency
- Proper SourceItem format conversion from legacy string sources
- Mixed source format compatibility
- Session ID generation and management

## Technical Implementation Details

### Static File Mounting Solution
Resolved the static file mounting issue mentioned in the requirements by creating a separate test app fixture that:
- Excludes static file mounting to avoid filesystem dependencies
- Replicates all API endpoints with mocked dependencies
- Maintains the same request/response models as the main application

### Test Coverage
- **18 new API-specific tests** added with `@pytest.mark.api` markers
- Tests organized into logical classes: `TestAPIEndpoints`, `TestAPIEndpointErrors`, `TestAPIDataValidation`, `TestAPIResponseFormats`
- All tests pass successfully (67/67 tests passing)

### Async Support
- Configured pytest for automatic async test handling
- Added httpx TestClient for async FastAPI endpoint testing
- All API tests properly handle async endpoint responses

## Impact on Frontend
While this is primarily backend testing infrastructure, these API endpoint tests ensure:
- Reliable API responses for frontend JavaScript fetch calls
- Proper error handling that frontend can gracefully handle
- Consistent data formats that frontend components expect
- Session management functionality that supports frontend user flows

## Test Execution
```bash
# Run only API tests
python -m pytest tests/test_api_endpoints.py -v -m api

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

All 67 tests pass successfully, including the new 18 API endpoint tests, ensuring no regressions were introduced to the existing test suite.
