# Frontend Changes and Code Quality Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines both the testing framework enhancements and code quality tools that have been implemented for the Course Materials Assistant project. These changes ensure better reliability, maintainability, and code quality for both backend and frontend components.

## Testing Framework Implementation

### 1. Added pytest Configuration (pyproject.toml)
- Added `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section with:
  - Configured test paths to `backend/tests`
  - Set up clean output formatting with verbose mode
  - Added markers for `unit`, `integration`, and `api` test categories
  - Disabled warnings and enabled colored output for better developer experience

### 2. Created Test Fixtures (backend/tests/conftest.py)
- **Shared fixtures** for consistent test setup across all API tests
- **Mock RAG system** fixture to avoid external dependencies during testing
- **Test FastAPI app** fixture that creates a clean test environment without static file mounting issues
- **Sample data fixtures** for course content, requests, and responses
- **Test client fixture** using FastAPI's TestClient for API endpoint testing

### 3. Comprehensive API Endpoint Tests (backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py)
- **Query Endpoint Tests** (`/api/query`):
  - Success scenarios with and without session IDs
  - Error handling for missing/invalid queries
  - Internal error handling and recovery
  - Response structure validation
  - JSON validation

- **Courses Endpoint Tests** (`/api/courses`):
  - Course statistics retrieval
  - Empty analytics handling
  - Error scenarios
  - Response structure validation

- **Root Endpoint Tests** (`/`):
  - Basic functionality testing
  - CORS header validation

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Multi-step user flows (check courses â†’ query)
  - Session persistence across multiple queries
  - Error recovery testing

### 4. Static File Mounting Issue Resolution
- Created separate test app configuration in conftest.py that avoids the static file mounting issues present in the main app.py
- This allows API tests to run without requiring the frontend directory structure
- Maintains full API functionality testing while isolating from frontend dependencies

## Code Quality Tools Implementation

### 1. Python Code Quality Tools
- **Black**: Added code formatter for consistent Python code style
- **isort**: Added import sorting tool for clean import organization
- **flake8**: Added linting tool for code quality checks

#### Configuration
- All tools configured in `pyproject.toml` with consistent settings
- Line length set to 88 characters (Black default)
- Import sorting configured to work with Black
- Flake8 configured to ignore Black-compatible formatting rules

### 2. Frontend Code Quality Tools

#### JavaScript/CSS Formatting
- **Prettier**: Added for consistent code formatting across JS, CSS, and HTML files
- **ESLint**: Added for JavaScript code quality and style enforcement

#### Configuration Files Created
- `frontend/package.json`: Node.js package configuration with development scripts
- `frontend/.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration for JavaScript and HTML linting
- `frontend/.prettierrc`: Prettier configuration for code formatting
- `frontend/.prettierignore`: Files to exclude from Prettier formatting

#### ESLint Rules
- Standard JavaScript style guide as base
- Custom rules for code quality:
  - `no-console`: Warn on console statements (useful for debugging)
  - `no-unused-vars`: Warn on unused variables
  - `prefer-const`: Error for variables that should be const
  - `no-var`: Error for using var instead of let/const
- Global variable `marked` configured for the markdown library

#### Prettier Configuration
- 2-space indentation for consistency
- Single quotes for strings
- Trailing commas for cleaner diffs
- 80-character line width for readability
- Special handling for CSS files with 100-character line width

### 3. Development Scripts

#### Root Level Scripts
- `quality_check.sh`: Comprehensive quality check script that runs all tools
  - Checks Python code formatting with Black
  - Checks import sorting with isort
  - Runs flake8 linting
  - Checks frontend formatting with Prettier
  - Runs ESLint on JavaScript files
- `format_code.sh`: Automatically formats all code
  - Formats Python code with Black and isort
  - Formats frontend code with Prettier and ESLint fixes

#### Frontend Scripts (via npm)
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint on JavaScript files
- `npm run lint:fix`: Run ESLint and automatically fix issues
- `npm run format`: Format all files with Prettier
- `npm run format:check`: Check if files are properly formatted
- `npm run quality:check`: Run both linting and format checks
- `npm run quality:fix`: Run both linting fixes and formatting

### 4. Code Formatting Applied
- All Python backend code has been formatted with Black and isort
- All frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) has been formatted with Prettier
- Import statements in Python files have been sorted and organized
- JavaScript code follows standard style conventions with custom enhancements

## Dependencies Added

"pytest-mock>=3.14.1",
"black>=23.0.0",
"flake8>=6.0.0",
"isort>=5.12.0",
```

### Node.js Dependencies (frontend/package.json)
```json
"eslint": "^8.57.0",
"eslint-config-standard": "^17.1.0",

```bash
# Run all API endpoint tests
uv run pytest backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py -v

# Run tests by marker
uv run pytest -m "api" -v

# Run all backend tests

```

### Code Quality
#### Daily Development Workflow
1. Make your code changes
2. Run `./format_code.sh` to automatically format all code
3. Run `./quality_check.sh` to verify code quality
4. Commit your changes

#### Quick Commands
- Format all code: `./format_code.sh`
- Check code quality: `./quality_check.sh`
- Frontend-only checks: `cd frontend && npm run quality:check`
- Frontend-only fixes: `cd frontend && npm run quality:fix`

### IDE Integration
The configuration files are compatible with most modern IDEs:
- VS Code: Install Python, ESLint, and Prettier extensions
- WebStorm/PyCharm: Built-in support for these tools
- Vim/Neovim: Use appropriate plugins for each tool

## Impact on Frontend Development

### Testing Benefits
- **API Contract Validation**: Ensures the API endpoints the frontend depends on maintain consistent behavior
- **Error Handling Coverage**: Tests verify proper error responses that frontend can handle gracefully
- **Session Management**: Validates session handling that supports frontend conversation persistence
- **Response Structure**: Ensures frontend receives data in expected format

### Development Workflow Improvements
- **Faster Feedback**: Developers can quickly validate API changes without manual testing
- **Regression Prevention**: Automated tests catch API breaking changes before they affect frontend
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of API behavior

### Quality Assurance
- **16 new API tests** covering all critical endpoints and error scenarios
- **Marker-based test organization** allows running specific test categories
- **Clean test isolation** prevents test interference and ensures reliable results

## Benefits
1. **API Reliability**: Consistent API response formats validated through tests
2. **Code Quality**: Automated linting catches potential issues early
3. **Consistency**: All code follows the same formatting standards
4. **Development Confidence**: Changes can be validated without breaking functionality
5. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-formatted code is easier to maintain
6. **Collaboration**: Consistent code style improves team collaboration

## Notes
- The scripts are designed to work from the project root directory
- All tools respect the project's existing file structure
- Configuration excludes generated files and dependencies
- Scripts provide colored output for better visibility of results
- Both tools can be run independently or together via the provided scripts
