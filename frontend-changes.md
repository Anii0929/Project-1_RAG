# Code Quality Tools Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Black Code Formatter
- Added `black>=25.1.0` to development dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- Configured black settings with 88-character line length and Python 3.10+ target
- Excluded common directories like `.git`, `.venv`, and `chroma_db` from formatting

### 2. Applied Consistent Formatting
- Ran black formatter across entire codebase
- 13 Python files were reformatted for consistency
- All backend code now follows consistent formatting standards

### 3. Created Development Scripts
Created three executable scripts in `/scripts/` directory:

#### `scripts/format.sh`
- Runs black formatter on entire codebase
- Use this to automatically format code before committing

#### `scripts/check-format.sh`
- Checks if code is properly formatted without making changes
- Returns exit code 1 if formatting issues are found
- Useful for CI/CD pipelines

#### `scripts/quality-check.sh`
- Comprehensive quality check script that runs:
  1. Test suite using pytest
  2. Code formatting validation
- Exits on first failure for fast feedback
- Perfect for pre-commit hooks or CI integration

## Usage

```bash
# Format all code
./scripts/format.sh

# Check formatting without changes
./scripts/check-format.sh

# Run all quality checks
./scripts/quality-check.sh
```

## Benefits

- **Consistent code style** across the entire codebase
- **Automated formatting** reduces manual code review overhead
- **Quality gates** ensure code meets standards before deployment
- **Developer efficiency** through automated tooling
- **CI/CD integration** ready scripts for pipeline automation
