# Frontend Changes Made

## Overview
Enhanced the testing framework for the RAG system backend to include comprehensive API endpoint testing infrastructure. While this primarily affects the backend testing capabilities, these changes ensure better reliability and maintainability of the API that the frontend depends on.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added pytest Configuration (pyproject.toml)
- Added `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section with:
  - Configured test paths to `backend/tests`
  - Set up clean output formatting with verbose mode
  - Added markers for `unit`, `integration`, and `api` test categories
  - Disabled warnings and enabled colored output for better developer experience

### 2. Created Test Fixtures (backend/tests/conftest.py)
- **Shared fixtures** for consistent test setup across all API tests
- **Mock RAG system** fixture to avoid external dependencies during testing
- **Test FastAPI app** fixture that creates a clean test environment without static file mounting issues
- **Sample data fixtures** for course content, requests, and responses
- **Test client fixture** using FastAPI's TestClient for API endpoint testing

### 3. Comprehensive API Endpoint Tests (backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py)
- **Query Endpoint Tests** (`/api/query`):
  - Success scenarios with and without session IDs
  - Error handling for missing/invalid queries
  - Internal error handling and recovery
  - Response structure validation
  - JSON validation

- **Courses Endpoint Tests** (`/api/courses`):
  - Course statistics retrieval
  - Empty analytics handling
  - Error scenarios
  - Response structure validation

- **Root Endpoint Tests** (`/`):
  - Basic functionality testing
  - CORS header validation

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Multi-step user flows (check courses â†’ query)
  - Session persistence across multiple queries
  - Error recovery testing

### 4. Static File Mounting Issue Resolution
- Created separate test app configuration in conftest.py that avoids the static file mounting issues present in the main app.py
- This allows API tests to run without requiring the frontend directory structure
- Maintains full API functionality testing while isolating from frontend dependencies

## Impact on Frontend Development

### Testing Benefits
- **API Contract Validation**: Ensures the API endpoints the frontend depends on maintain consistent behavior
- **Error Handling Coverage**: Tests verify proper error responses that frontend can handle gracefully
- **Session Management**: Validates session handling that supports frontend conversation persistence
- **Response Structure**: Ensures frontend receives data in expected format

### Development Workflow Improvements
- **Faster Feedback**: Developers can quickly validate API changes without manual testing
- **Regression Prevention**: Automated tests catch API breaking changes before they affect frontend
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of API behavior

### Quality Assurance
- **16 new API tests** covering all critical endpoints and error scenarios
- **Marker-based test organization** allows running specific test categories
- **Clean test isolation** prevents test interference and ensures reliable results

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all API endpoint tests
uv run pytest backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py -v

# Run tests by marker
uv run pytest -m "api" -v

# Run all backend tests
uv run pytest -v
```

## Future Frontend Benefits
These testing improvements provide a solid foundation for:
- **Confident API integration** in frontend components
- **Reliable error handling** in the user interface
- **Consistent data flow** from backend to frontend
- **Easier debugging** when issues arise between frontend and backend
