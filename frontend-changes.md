# Development Infrastructure Changes

## Code Quality Tools Implementation

### 1. Added Black Code Formatter
- Added `black>=25.1.0` to development dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- Configured black settings with 88-character line length and Python 3.10+ target
- Excluded common directories like `.git`, `.venv`, and `chroma_db` from formatting

### 2. Applied Consistent Formatting
- Ran black formatter across entire codebase
- 13 Python files were reformatted for consistency
- All backend code now follows consistent formatting standards

### 3. Created Development Scripts
Created three executable scripts in `/scripts/` directory:

#### `scripts/format.sh`
- Runs black formatter on entire codebase
- Use this to automatically format code before committing

#### `scripts/check-format.sh`
- Checks if code is properly formatted without making changes
- Returns exit code 1 if formatting issues are found
- Useful for CI/CD pipelines

#### `scripts/quality-check.sh`
- Comprehensive quality check script that runs:
  1. Test suite using pytest
  2. Code formatting validation
- Exits on first failure for fast feedback
- Perfect for pre-commit hooks or CI integration

## Enhanced Testing Framework

### 1. pytest Configuration (pyproject.toml)
- Added comprehensive pytest configuration with test discovery settings
- Added pytest-asyncio dependency for async endpoint testing
- Configured test markers for unit, integration, and API tests
- Set up proper test paths and collection patterns

### 2. Enhanced Test Fixtures (backend/tests/conftest.py)
**New fixtures added:**
- `mock_rag_system`: Mock RAG system for isolated API testing
- `test_app`: Complete test FastAPI application without static file dependencies
- `client`: Synchronous test client for API testing
- `async_client`: Asynchronous test client for comprehensive API testing
- `sample_query_request`: Standardized test data for query endpoints
- `sample_course_data`: Mock course data for testing
- `test_config`: Enhanced configuration with temporary database support

**Key improvements:**
- Resolved static file mounting issues in test environment
- Added proper async testing support
- Comprehensive mocking for isolated unit tests

### 3. Comprehensive API Endpoint Tests (backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py)
**Test coverage includes:**

#### Query Endpoint (/api/query)
- Session ID handling (with/without existing session)
- Empty query handling
- Invalid payload validation
- Malformed JSON handling
- Async testing support

#### Courses Endpoint (/api/courses)
- Course statistics retrieval
- Response schema validation
- Async testing support

#### Root Endpoint (/)
- Basic API information endpoint
- Response format validation

#### Error Handling Tests
- 404 responses for nonexistent endpoints
- 405 responses for wrong HTTP methods
- CORS OPTIONS request handling

#### Response Format Validation
- JSON schema compliance testing
- Content-type header verification
- Data type validation for all response fields

#### Mock Integration Tests
- Verification that mocked components are properly called
- Session management testing
- Analytics endpoint integration testing

## Benefits

### Code Quality
- **Consistent code style** across the entire codebase
- **Automated formatting** reduces manual code review overhead
- **Quality gates** ensure code meets standards before deployment
- **Developer efficiency** through automated tooling
- **CI/CD integration** ready scripts for pipeline automation

### Testing Infrastructure
- **API Contract Validation**: Ensures API endpoints match expected schemas
- **Error Handling**: Validates proper error responses for frontend error handling
- **Session Management**: Tests session ID creation and management flow
- **CORS Support**: Validates cross-origin request handling
- **Isolated Testing**: Mock-based testing prevents external dependencies
- **Async Support**: Full async/await testing capabilities
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 19 test cases covering all major API scenarios
- **CI/CD Ready**: Pytest configuration suitable for automated testing pipelines

## Usage Instructions

### Formatting Code
```bash
# Format all Python files
./scripts/format.sh

# Check formatting without changes
./scripts/check-format.sh

# Run complete quality checks
./scripts/quality-check.sh
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific test types
uv run pytest -m unit
uv run pytest -m api
```

## Testing Results
- **Total Tests**: 42 (including existing unit tests)
- **API Tests**: 19 new comprehensive API endpoint tests
- **Pass Rate**: 100% (all tests passing)
- **Coverage**: Complete API endpoint coverage with error scenarios

## Impact on Development Workflow
This enhanced testing framework provides:
1. Confidence in API stability during frontend development
2. Early detection of API contract changes
3. Validation of request/response formats
4. Comprehensive error scenario testing
5. Foundation for integration testing between frontend and backend

The testing infrastructure now supports both isolated unit testing and comprehensive API integration testing, making it safer to develop and modify both frontend and backend components.
