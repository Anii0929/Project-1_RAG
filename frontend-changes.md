# Frontend Changes - Dark/Light Theme Toggle Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a fully functional dark/light theme toggle for the RAG Chatbot application with smooth transitions and persistent user preferences.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Modifications (`frontend/index.html`)
- **Added Theme Toggle Button**: Positioned fixed in the top-right corner with sun/moon SVG icons
  - Button includes accessibility attributes (`aria-label`, `title`)
  - Contains two SVG icons that switch based on active theme
  - Located at lines 13-21

### 2. CSS Enhancements (`frontend/style.css`)

#### CSS Variables (lines 8-44)
- **Separated theme variables**: Created distinct variable sets for dark and light themes
- **Dark theme (default)**: Original color scheme maintained as the default theme
- **Light theme**: Carefully selected colors for optimal readability:
  - White background (`#ffffff`)
  - Light surface color (`#f8fafc`)
  - Dark text colors for contrast (`#1e293b` primary, `#64748b` secondary)
  - Adjusted borders and shadows for light mode
- **Added transition duration variable**: `--transition-duration: 0.3s` for consistent animations

#### Theme Toggle Button Styles (lines 820-900)
- **Button styling**: Fixed position, circular design with shadow
- **Icon styling**: Color-coded icons (yellow sun, blue moon)
- **Theme-based visibility**: Icons show/hide based on active theme using CSS attribute selectors
- **Hover/active states**: Smooth elevation changes and hover effects
- **Focus accessibility**: Clear focus ring for keyboard navigation
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Adjusted size for smaller screens (lines 739-749)

#### Smooth Transitions (lines 886-900)
- Added transition properties to all theme-aware elements for smooth color changes
- Body element includes background and text color transitions (lines 56-57)

### 3. JavaScript Functionality (`frontend/script.js`)

#### State Management (lines 5-6)
- Added `currentTheme` variable to track active theme
- Theme preference stored in localStorage for persistence

#### Initialization (lines 20-23)
- Added `themeToggle` DOM element reference
- Call `initializeTheme()` on page load to apply saved preference

#### Event Listeners (lines 38-39)
- Added click event listener for theme toggle button

#### Theme Functions (lines 245-278)
- **`initializeTheme()`**: 
  - Retrieves saved theme from localStorage
  - Applies appropriate theme on page load
  - Defaults to dark theme if no preference exists
  
- **`toggleTheme()`**:
  - Switches between light and dark themes
  - Updates `data-theme` attribute on body element
  - Saves preference to localStorage
  - Adds rotation animation to button for visual feedback

## Key Features

### User Experience
1. **Smooth Transitions**: All color changes animate smoothly (0.3s duration)
2. **Visual Feedback**: Button rotates 360° when clicked
3. **Persistent Preference**: Theme choice saved in localStorage
4. **Accessible Design**: 
   - Keyboard navigable with clear focus states
   - ARIA labels for screen readers
   - Sufficient color contrast in both themes

### Technical Implementation
1. **CSS Variables**: Theme switching via CSS custom properties
2. **Attribute-based Theming**: Uses `data-theme="light"` attribute
3. **Icon Switching**: Pure CSS solution for icon visibility
4. **No JavaScript Dependencies**: Vanilla JavaScript implementation
5. **Mobile Responsive**: Adapts button size for mobile devices

### Design Consistency
- Maintains existing visual hierarchy
- Preserves current design language
- Both themes follow the same structure
- Colors carefully selected for readability and accessibility

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with CSS variable support
- localStorage for preference persistence
- SVG support for icons
- CSS transitions for animations
