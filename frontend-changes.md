# Frontend Code Quality Tools Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the code quality tools and development workflow improvements that have been implemented for the Course Materials Assistant project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Python Code Quality Tools
- **Black**: Added code formatter for consistent Python code style
- **isort**: Added import sorting tool for clean import organization
- **flake8**: Added linting tool for code quality checks

#### Configuration
- All tools configured in `pyproject.toml` with consistent settings
- Line length set to 88 characters (Black default)
- Import sorting configured to work with Black
- Flake8 configured to ignore Black-compatible formatting rules

### 2. Frontend Code Quality Tools

#### JavaScript/CSS Formatting
- **Prettier**: Added for consistent code formatting across JS, CSS, and HTML files
- **ESLint**: Added for JavaScript code quality and style enforcement

#### Configuration Files Created
- `frontend/package.json`: Node.js package configuration with development scripts
- `frontend/.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration for JavaScript and HTML linting
- `frontend/.prettierrc`: Prettier configuration for code formatting
- `frontend/.prettierignore`: Files to exclude from Prettier formatting

#### ESLint Rules
- Standard JavaScript style guide as base
- Custom rules for code quality:
  - `no-console`: Warn on console statements (useful for debugging)
  - `no-unused-vars`: Warn on unused variables
  - `prefer-const`: Error for variables that should be const
  - `no-var`: Error for using var instead of let/const
- Global variable `marked` configured for the markdown library

#### Prettier Configuration
- 2-space indentation for consistency
- Single quotes for strings
- Trailing commas for cleaner diffs
- 80-character line width for readability
- Special handling for CSS files with 100-character line width

### 3. Development Scripts

#### Root Level Scripts
- `quality_check.sh`: Comprehensive quality check script that runs all tools
  - Checks Python code formatting with Black
  - Checks import sorting with isort
  - Runs flake8 linting
  - Checks frontend formatting with Prettier
  - Runs ESLint on JavaScript files
- `format_code.sh`: Automatically formats all code
  - Formats Python code with Black and isort
  - Formats frontend code with Prettier and ESLint fixes

#### Frontend Scripts (via npm)
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint on JavaScript files
- `npm run lint:fix`: Run ESLint and automatically fix issues
- `npm run format`: Format all files with Prettier
- `npm run format:check`: Check if files are properly formatted
- `npm run quality:check`: Run both linting and format checks
- `npm run quality:fix`: Run both linting fixes and formatting

### 4. Code Formatting Applied
- All Python backend code has been formatted with Black and isort
- All frontend code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) has been formatted with Prettier
- Import statements in Python files have been sorted and organized
- JavaScript code follows standard style conventions with custom enhancements

### 5. Dependencies Added

#### Python Dependencies (pyproject.toml)
```toml
"black>=23.0.0",
"flake8>=6.0.0",
"isort>=5.12.0",
```

#### Node.js Dependencies (frontend/package.json)
```json
"eslint": "^8.57.0",
"eslint-config-standard": "^17.1.0",
"eslint-plugin-import": "^2.29.1",
"eslint-plugin-n": "^16.6.2",
"eslint-plugin-promise": "^6.1.1",
"prettier": "^3.2.5",
"@html-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^0.24.1",
"@html-eslint/parser": "^0.24.1"
```

## Usage

### Daily Development Workflow
1. Make your code changes
2. Run `./format_code.sh` to automatically format all code
3. Run `./quality_check.sh` to verify code quality
4. Commit your changes

### Quick Commands
- Format all code: `./format_code.sh`
- Check code quality: `./quality_check.sh`
- Frontend-only checks: `cd frontend && npm run quality:check`
- Frontend-only fixes: `cd frontend && npm run quality:fix`

### IDE Integration
The configuration files are compatible with most modern IDEs:
- VS Code: Install Python, ESLint, and Prettier extensions
- WebStorm/PyCharm: Built-in support for these tools
- Vim/Neovim: Use appropriate plugins for each tool

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: All code follows the same formatting standards
2. **Quality**: Automated linting catches potential issues early
3. **Efficiency**: Automated formatting reduces manual work
4. **Collaboration**: Consistent code style improves team collaboration
5. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-formatted code is easier to maintain

## Notes
- The scripts are designed to work from the project root directory
- All tools respect the project's existing file structure
- Configuration excludes generated files and dependencies
- Scripts provide colored output for better visibility of results
- Both tools can be run independently or together via the provided scripts
