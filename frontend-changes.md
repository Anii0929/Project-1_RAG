- CSS custom properties for easy theme switching
- Scoped theme variables under `[data-theme="light"]` selector
- Universal transition rules for smooth theme changes

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers supporting CSS custom properties

## Usage
Users can:
- Click the theme toggle button to switch between themes

- System theme changes are respected when no manual preference is set

The implementation maintains all existing functionality while adding a polished theme switching experience that integrates seamlessly with the current design.
